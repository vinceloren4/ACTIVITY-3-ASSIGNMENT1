    <h1>Why I Chose BSIT</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
      I chose <b>BSIT</b> because ever since I was in high school, I was inspired by watching my cousin do <strong>coding and programming</strong>.
      That’s why I wanted to take an <i>I.T. course</i> when I entered college.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, after graduating from junior high school and moving into senior high school, my mind changed. 
      I <em>started wanting to pursue nursing instead</em>. 
      But when I graduated from senior high school, my mom couldn’t afford to send me to a nursing course.
      That’s why I went back to my original plan and chose the <mark>I.T. course</mark>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask me whether I regret taking BSIT, my answer is <strong>no</strong> because I.T. was actually my <small>first choice</small> from the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another reason I chose BSIT is because of the opportunities it offers. 
      We live in a digital age where technology plays a vital role in almost every industry. 
      From <del>only business</del> <ins>healthcare and business</ins> to education and entertainment, IT professionals are in demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, I chose BSIT because I enjoy learning how to solve problems. Programming challenges me to think critically and creatively. 
      It’s not always easy, but the satisfaction I get from making a program work or fixing an error motivates me to keep learning and improving.
      For example, I learned that H<sub>2</sub>O means water, and x<sup>2</sup> means x squared—just like in coding, where symbols and details matter.
